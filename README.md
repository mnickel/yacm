There is no real database behind the scenes -- everything is kept inside of a PHP session

Code is located as follows:

- lib -- dataTables and bootstrap library location
- js -- javascript code for the project to orchestrate UI interaction and behaviors
- css -- custom CSS
- api -- all PHP code to perform all CRUD operations


You should be able to install this on any PHP environment.  This was developed using a vagrant development environment -- (http://www.vagrantup.com/)
